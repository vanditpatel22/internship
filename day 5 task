1)Create a function getting two integer inputs from user. & print the following:

Addition of two numbers is +value

Subtraction of two numbers is +value

Division of two numbers is +value

Multiplication of two numbers is +value

a = int(input())
b = int(input())

def arithmetic(x,y):
    print("Addition of two numbers is =",x+y)
    print("Subtraction of two numbers is =",x-y)
    print("Division of two numbers is =",x/y)
    print("Multiplication of two numbers is =",x*y)
    
arithmetic(a,b)

Output:-

10
5
Addition of two numbers is = 15
Subtraction of two numbers is = 5
Division of two numbers is = 2.0
Multiplication of two numbers is = 50


2) Create a function covid( ) & it should accept patient name, and body temperature, by default the body temperature should be 98 degree.

name = input()
tem = int(input())
def covid(name,t=98):
    print("patient's name =",name)
    print("patient's temperature =",t)
covid(name,tem)

Output:-

PATEL VANDIT
97
patient's name = PATEL VANDIT
patient's temperature = 97

GITA BEN
98
patient's name = GITA BEN
patient's temperature = 98
